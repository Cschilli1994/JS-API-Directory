    Javascript based webpage that requests 12 random employees from an API. Then dynamically builds each employees profile and 
modal cards using data from the response and appends them to the page. The modals are hidden until an employees card is 
selected from the gallery. A search bar is included to filter out employees that dont match what is typed in the box. While 
searching if the user selects an employee profile card the modal navigation buttons will only navigate through employees matched
by the search.

CSS changes from original:
    Changed body background color to an off white-yellow
    Changed profile cards background color on hover and border changes
        more apparent indication of selection
    Added a border for modal navigation buttons on hover
